Research developer. Interested in the intersection between computation and biology. 
Formerly worked in high performance computing, but has since taken an interest in Neuroscience
and am currently a Research Fellow at NParks Singapore, working on bioinformatics support for
the genomics and genetics work done there.

The big bucketlist goal of mine - to understand and simulate the structure of cortical columns.
They are very appealing because they are almost templated units of something repeated over and
over in something akin to a giant interconnected 2D array.

I would like to understand what kind of computation a cortical column supports. I would like to
connect a functioning in silico-simulation of an instance of C. Elegans to a set of cortical columns,
logically ignore timing and scale issues, and see if this "oracle" ends up altering the behavior
of said nematode under different scenarios in its digital immortal life.
